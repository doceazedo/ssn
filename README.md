  Over-engineered open-source Minecraft anarchy server — made in Brasil 🇧🇷✨
</p>

## 🗂 What's inside?

This monorepo uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a package manager. It includes the following applications:

- [`apps`](./apps): web applications related to the server
- [`packages`](./packages): libraries shared between apps
- [`plugins`](./plugins): first-party Minecraft plugins source code
- [`servers`](./servers): the Minecraft servers configuration files and plugin binaries

## 📦 Dependencies

Make sure you have **Node.js v18** installed with **npm v8** or up. You can easily change your Node version using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):
```bash
nvm install 18
node --version
```

For plugin development, you will need **JDK 17** and **Maven**. To install them on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), run:
```bash
brew install openjdk@17 maven
```

Finally, you will also need to have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed. You can easily get both by installing the much recommended [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## ⚡️ Get started

First off, install the dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

Then, you will need to setup your environment variables. You can do this by copying the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, open your `/etc/hosts` file and add these lines to the end:
```
127.0.0.1 ssn.local id.ssn.local gk.ssn.local rcon.ssn.local
::1       ssn.local id.ssn.local gk.ssn.local rcon.ssn.local
```

Start the containers by running this command:
```bash
npm run start
```

You should now be able to join the Minecraft server on **localhost:25565** and open [ssn.local](http://ssn.local) in your browser.

## 🧰 Build

To build a plugin and copy the artifact to the server, you can run this command:
```bash
# npm run build:plugin-name
npm run build:catraca
```

All services are rebuilt on start by default.

## 🚀 Deploy

Currently, there is no specific deployment process but you can generally follow the development environment steps and:

- Only expose the `25565` and `80` ports from your server
- Setup the environment variables properly
  - Generate random and strong passwords for the keys
  - Configure the memory allocation according to your server
  - Fill in external sevice keys (like Discord, Turnstile and SendGrid)
  - Update the volume mount points to local paths

Please keep in mind that these are general guidelines and your specific deployment process may differ.

## 🤒 Known issues

These are known issues with the current setup of this project:

- Unfortunately, `npm run start` is also being used as the development environment at this moment. This means no hot reloading, you will have to restart it everytime you change something. **Help on setting one up is much appreciated.**
- As you restart your instance multiple times, a gigantic build cache will form until your containers are out of space. When that happens, run `docker system prune --volumes`.
