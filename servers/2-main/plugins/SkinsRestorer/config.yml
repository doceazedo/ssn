# (?) Step by step installation guide: https://skinsrestorer.net/docs/installation

# (!) IF YOU ARE USING A PROXY (BungeeCord, Waterfall or Velocity), YOU NEED TO INSTALL SKINSRESTORER ON THE PROXY AND ALL SERVERS! (!)
# (!) YOU ALSO NEED TO CONFIGURE YOUR SERVERS TO DETECT THE PROXY! (!)
# (!) AND YOU ALSO NEED TO PUT THE SAME CONFIG FILE IN ALL PROXIES AND SERVERS! (!)
