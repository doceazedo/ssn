    # Re-enables SPIGOT-5988, also known as 'auto-bed'
    # From Minecraft version 1.16 (≈June 2020) to version 1.17.1(≈October 2021)
    # there was a bug (SPIGOT-5988) which did not reset the respawn point of the
    # player after death, if his bed was blocked with a shulker.
    # After dying a second time, the player will be back at his bed again.
    # This bug persisted from the Spigot server to Paper and all its forks until
    # October 2021, after which it was fixed by the Spigot development team.
    # Attempts by players to reach out to Spigot to allow them to disable the patch
    # that fixes the SPIGOT-5988 bug have failed.
